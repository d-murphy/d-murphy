### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan.  After working 4+ years as a Data Analyst, I recently started a batch at the [Recurse Center](recurse.com) where I've been improving my web development skills.  Here's a look at the projects I've completed recently. 

* An interactive dashboard visualizing data on [spacewalks](https://d-murphy.github.io/spacewalk-dashboard/)
* A web app for [public libraries](https://github.com/d-murphy/LibraryPrograms) to advertise open events (this may take a second to load)
* [Data visualization](https://d-murphy.github.io/StravaRunDataDashboard.html) of my personal running data
* An [airport code quiz](https://d-murphy.github.io/airport-code-game/)

See the pins below for the source code and project objectives.  

I have a few additional projects linked on my [portfolio](https://d-murphy.github.io/) along with my [resume](https://d-murphy.github.io/resume.html).  Reach out if you have questions!
