### Hi there

I'm Dan.  I recently finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), a self-directed programming retreat.  I spent the time growing my web dev toolkit with project based learning.  Here's a look at the things I worked on: 

* An interactive dashboard visualizing data on [spacewalks](https://d-murphy.github.io/spacewalk-dashboard/) 
* A demonstration of the stages of the [medical residency match algorithm](https://residency-match-demo.herokuapp.com/) 
* An HR [video training site](https://talentcheck.pro/) 
* [Data visualization](https://d-murphy.github.io/StravaRunDataDashboard.html) of my personal running data
* A [hex/rgb color picker](https://d-murphy.github.io/BinaryColorPicker/) with binary controls

See the pinned projects below for the source code and project objectives.  

There's also a complete list of my personal projects if you'd like to see more.
