### Hi there

Thanks for checking out the page.  I'm currently working as a developer in NY at [Thrive](https://thrivenextgen.com/), an IT managed service provider.  In my role, I build internal web applications with a Node / Express, React, Mongo stack.  Here are a few projects I've worked on outside of work: 

#### Web Dev

* A web app for the [NYS FD Drill Teams](https://nysfddrillteams.com/) to archive 60 years of event results and organize video links.
* A [chrome extension](http://catalogmaps631.com) adding maps to library catalog pages.  
* An interactive dashboard visualizing data on [spacewalks](https://d-murphy.github.io/spacewalk-dashboard/)  (React, D3)

#### Data Analysis / Statistical Modeling

* [Parking Meters < Fines?](https://www.kaggle.com/code/murphydan/how-often-should-you-pay-the-parking-meter/notebook) simulation analysis (R script)
* [Craigslist Car Ads](https://www.kaggle.com/code/murphydan/craigslist-cars-eda/report) exploratory data analysis (R script)
* [PAT Index](https://patindex.wordpress.com/) - a bit arcane, but a 538 style forecast for a fireman drill team contest (R scripts, R Shiny App, Wordpress blog)

There's also a [complete list](https://github.com/d-murphy/d-murphy/blob/main/completeProjectList.md) of projects I've worked on.
