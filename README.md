### Hi there

I'm Dan and this is my github page.  I'm currently working as a full stack engineer.  Previously, I attended the Recurse Center and worked as a data analyst.  Here's a few things I've built on the internet:  

* A [chrome extension](http://catalogmaps631.com) adding maps to Suffolk County library catalog pages.
* A demonstration of the stages of the [medical residency match algorithm](https://residency-match-demo.herokuapp.com/) 
* An interactive dashboard visualizing data on [spacewalks](https://d-murphy.github.io/spacewalk-dashboard/) 
* [Data visualization](https://d-murphy.github.io/StravaRunDataDashboard.html) of my personal running data
* A [hex/rgb color picker](https://d-murphy.github.io/BinaryColorPicker/) with binary controls

There's also a [complete list](https://github.com/d-murphy/d-murphy/blob/main/completeProjectList.md) of my personal projects if you'd like to see more and track how my interests have changed over time.
